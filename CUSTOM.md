# Custom Changes for this Build

This build is an unofficial preview version, consisting of features I wanted to testdrive early. They might cause instability, so be careful and backup everything.

## Key Features:
- Remember the last connected hub name, so flashing of new firmware is easier
- Import from and export to Google drive, based on [@scatwang's work](https://github.com/scatwang/pybricks-code)
- Import and convert blockly files (.llsp3, .llsp, .lsm)
- HubCentral dialog (a.k.a portview) for custom firmware builds (!)
- Terminal window show/hide shortcut (Alt-T)
- Help window show/hide shortcut (Alt-F1)
- Upon error jump to compiler error automatically

## Work in Planning or Progress:
- Simpler connect or autoconnect for Bluetooth (!)
- Github or gist sync
- Import of further blockly types maybe .lmsp (ev3 classroom), even later maybe .ev3, .ev3m...
- drag-and-drop import files

(!) means that either upcoming or proposed firmware change is needed as well
