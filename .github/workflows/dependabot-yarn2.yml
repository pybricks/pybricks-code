# Automatically save updated `yarn.lock` file for dependabot PRs.
# This is necessary because dependabot doesn't support Yarn v2 yet:
# https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1297
#
# Note: We use the `pull_request_target` event due to GitHub security measures.
#       It is important to ensure we don't execute any untrusted PR code in this context.
