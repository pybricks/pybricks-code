- Updated to Pybricks Firmware v3.1.0:

  #### Changed
  - Renamed new `DCMotor.dc_settings()` method to `DCMotor.settings()` ([support#536]).

  #### Fixed
  - Fixed direction for `DriveBase.turn()` and `Drivebase.curve()` for some
    arguments ([support#535]).
  - Fixed `then=Stop.COAST` not working in `DriveBase` methods ([support#535]).

  [support#535]: https://github.com/pybricks/support/issues/535
  [support#536]: https://github.com/pybricks/support/issues/536

- Updated docs:

  #### Added
  - Added maximum voltage setter for `DCMotor` and `Motor`.
  - Documented `DriveBase.curve()` method.

  #### Changed
  - Removed `duty` setting from `Control.limits` method.
  - Removed `integral_range` setting from `Control.pid` method.

## [1.1.0-rc.1] - 2021-11-19

### Added
- Hub name setting for selecting hub name when flashing firmware ([support#52]).

### Changed
- Updated to Pybricks firmware v3.1.0c1:

  #### Added
  - Added `DriveBase.curve()` method to drive an arc segment.
  - Added `then` and `wait` arguments to `DriveBase` methods ([support#57]).

  #### Changed
  - Dropped `integral_range` argument from `Control.pid()`. This setting was
    ineffective and never used. When set incorrectly, the motor could get stuck
    for certain combinations of `kp` and `ki`.
  - Improved motor behavior for cases with low-speed, low-load, but high
    inertia ([support#366]).
  - Changed how the duty cycle limit is set for `Motor` and `DCMotor`. It is now
    set as a voltage limit via a dedicated method, instead of `Motor.control`.

  #### Fixed
  - Fixed `then=Stop.COAST` being ignored in most motor commands.
  - Fixed `brake()`/`light.off()` not working on Move hub I/O port C ([support#501]).
  - Fixed `Remote()` failing to connect when hub is connected to 2019 or newer
    MacBooks ([support#397]).
  - Fixed intermittent improper detection of hot-plugged I/O devices ([support#500]).
  - A program now stops when a `Motor` is unplugged while it is running, instead
    of getting in a bad state.

## [1.1.0-beta.6] - 2021-09-21

### Added
- Show error message if connected hub is running old firmware ([support#482]).

### Changed
- Updated dependencies.
- Updated to Pybricks firmware v3.1.0b1:

  #### Added
  - Support for LEGO Technic Color Light Matrix ([support#440]).
  - Support for LEGO UART devices with a new battery power flag. This is
    required to support the new LEGO Technic Color Light Matrix ([support#440]).
  - Support for the SPIKE Essential hub/Technic Small hub ([support#439]).

  #### Fixed
  - Fixed Ultrasonic Sensor and Color Sensor turning off when a
    user script ends ([support#456]).
  - Hub reset due to watchdog timer when writing data to UART I/O device
    ([support#304]).
  - City/Technic hubs not connecting via Bluetooth on macOS 12 ([support#489]).

  #### Changed:
  - Updated to MicroPython v1.17.

## [1.1.0-beta.5] - 2021-08-30

### Changed
- Updated to Pybricks firmware v3.1.0a4:

  #### Added
  - Enabled builtin `bytearray` ([pybricks-code#60]).
  - Enabled `ustruct` module ([pybricks-code#60]).
  - Added alpha support for dual boot installation on the SPIKE Prime Hub.
  - Added `pybricks.experimental.hello_world` function to make it easier for
    new contributors to experiment with Pybricks using C code.
  - Added ability to import the `main.mpy` that is embedded in the firmware from
    a download and run program ([support#408]).
  - Added `pybricks.iodevices.LWP3Device` to communicate with a device that supports
    the LEGO Wireless Protocol 3.0.00 ([pybricks-code#68])

  #### Changed
  - Move Hub Bluetooth optimizations to reduce firmware size ([pybricks-code#49]).
  - Disabled `pybricks.iodevices` module on Move Hub to reduce firmware size.
  - Improvements to `pybricks.pupdevices.Remote`:
    - Check if a remote is already connected before attempting to create a new
      connection.
    - Rename first argument from `address` to `name` to match documentation.
    - Implement connecting by name.
    - Add `name()` method.
